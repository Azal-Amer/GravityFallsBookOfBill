<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: -2rem">In ancient times, âTruthâ was whatever most recently came out of a king or priestâs mouth, and if you disagreed, your neck had a date with the guillotine.  (DID U KNOW? Your head stays conscious 3 seconds after decapitation. FUN GAME: Try to lick the basket!)</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: 1rem">Then a new type of person was invented: The Nerd, and they invented a new kind of method: Scientific.</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: 1rem">As annoying as the nerds were, their methods got results. Flame throwers, roller coasters, space travel and saturated fat were all created by the overdeveloped frontal lobes of these socially challenged dweebs. For a while, it seemed like the nerds of Earth had won the right to decide what truth was.</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: 1rem">But that didnât last too long. Non-nerds started getting sick of hearing unflattering truths. They longed for a way to shove truth back in the locker and take its lunch money. And they figured out a way to do it! The solution? The free market!</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: 1rem">Turns out, human beings dont really care whatâs true or not, they care about what makes them feel good, and theyâll take a lollypop over a depressing essay about global warming any day!</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: 1rem">Now truth is just another part of the supply/demand market. Whatever truth you want, you can find someone who will sell it to you. Neither kings nor nerds can tell you what reality is- you can climb inside your own reality and die in there with a smile on your face, like a rat happily drowning in  high fructose corn syrup! Everyone thought I was a âpsychopathâ for trapping Mabel in a reality bubble, but you geniuses have created reality bubbles for yourselves. Which is frankly great, because your inability to share any kind of consensus on reality makes you easier to conquer and only brings the downfall of your entire civilization closer!</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 200">Since truth is up-for-grabs, the world belongs to whoever can master the art of âreality-bending,â also known as LYING. </p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: -1rem; font-weight: 200">TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHOâS BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK, KID!</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: -1rem; font-weight: 200">LIE UNTIL WHAT YOU WANT TO BE TRUE BECOMES TRUE. </p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: -1rem; font-weight: 200">LIE UNTIL YOU CANT REMEMBER WHATS A LIE AND WHAT ISNT.</p>
