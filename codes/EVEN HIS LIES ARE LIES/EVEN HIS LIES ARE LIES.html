<p class="font-kidwriting" style="margin-top: -2rem">As we played our first game of chess, I read Sixerâs thoughts:</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting"><strong>âRook to B12? No no, heâll expect that. Heâll expect any of my gambits. Unless I do something completely, utterly random! Thatâll throw him! Unless...heâs counting on random? Whatâs the opposite of random? Predictable! Heâll never predict that!â</strong></p>
<p class="font-kidwriting">It never once occurred to him what my real strategy was: letting him win. Because winning made him feel special. And good god, did he want to feel special. A quick perusal of his memories showed that Sixerâs entire sense of self worth was tied up in his self image as a lone genius, causing him to ride an endless see-saw between dizzying ego and plummeting insecurity. The truth was, he was half a genius. The other half seemed to be frozen at the age of 18, still a child, totally dependent on outside praise, terrible at understanding and relating to others. A perfect pawn!</p>

<p class="font-kidwriting">You say it like itâs a bad thing! Tools are useful! You try putting a nail in a board using your forehead and tell me how you feel about hammers after!</p>
<p class="font-serif"><strong>SO YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT FORD?</strong></p>
<p class="font-kidwriting">I never said that. Everyone likes having a pet human! As long as he remembers when to sit, stay, and roll over control of his entire life! If you ever find a henchman, youâll need to do the same! Oh, but youâre too âmindfulâ for things like henchmen, arenât you?</p>
