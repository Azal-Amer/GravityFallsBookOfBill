<p style="margin-top: -6rem">Pacifica stormed into her palatial bedroom and slammed the door so hard her chandeliers shook. (There were at least 3 chandeliers in Pacificaâs room, including a teensy chandelier over her nightlight.) She buried her head in a velvet pillow and screamed for an inhumanly long time, then flopped over and stewed at the painted cherubs on her ceiling. It wasnât <em>FAIR</em>. After everything she did for her parents- get up at 5 for fencing lessons, beauty pageants, fox-hunting, butler-hunting, cleaning up the black feathers after dads weird âgrown up masquerade partiesâ- <em>THIS</em> is how they repay her? HER! <strong><em>PACIFICA ELISA NORTHWEST?!</em></strong></p>
<p>It had been a rough summer for Pacifica- first she came alarmingly close to losing a Party Crown, then her golf skills were called into question, and now her parents grounded her for literally saving the entire family from a Category 10 ghost and shut off the spigot on her caviar tap for rest of the year. What was she supposed to eat now? <em>Dog Food?</em> She angrily opened her mini-fridge and pulled out an <strong>UpperCrustables</strong><sup>TM</sup> brand snack pack and angrily spread the caviar on the tiny baguette. <span style="color: #E035F4">âUgh, why does it come with this dumb little stick? The caviar always gets stuck in the <em>CORNERS!</em>â</span></p>
<p>She looked at a napkin where Dipper had written the shackâs phone number in case killing the ghost might have created a âdouble ghost.â Ha! As if she would put HIS number in HER phone.</p>
<p>Everything in her life used to make so much more sense before those PINES twins came along and screwed everything up. That stupid Mabel and her baffling, undeserved confidence. That know-it-all sweat stain Dipper whoâs giant head was always butting against hers.  Something about Dipperâs words had knocked over a domino in her mind that started a chain reaction that was causing her whole identity to come crashing down. He told her she had potential to change intoâ¦a better person? How do you become a <em>better person</em> when youâre already the <em>best person?</em><br/><em>It didnât make sense!</em></p>
<p>Thinking about it exhausted her, and soon, her eyelids began to droop.</p>
<p>Soon she was...</p>
<p style="margin-top: 60px">     she was...</p>

<p>In Pacificaâs dream, she was freshening up at a party washing her hands when she noticed something...<br/><span style="color: #F51616">red</span><br/>swirling in the drain.</p>
<p>In horror, she discovered her hands were covered in blood, and no matter how hard she scrubbed them, they wouldnât come clean. On the mirror, words slowly started two write themselves on their own, as if by an invisible handâ¦</p>
<img alt="BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS" src="image_2.png" style="padding: 0 2rem"/>
<p style="color: #E035F4">âNO, NO, ITâS NOT MY FAULT!â</p>
<p>An overpowering sense of guilt swelled inside as she fled to the ballroom for help, where she spotted her friends gossiping by a tapestry. She tried to flip them around, but when she grabbed their shoulders, they fell over, flat, They were... cardboard? She turned to her parents, and they fell over flat too. The entire party was filled with flat, 2D people, everyone was fake. Blood began to fill the ballroom, pouring from the clock, from the paintings, from the ceiling. Why was this happening?! She raced through her manor in a blind panic, when she discovered she was no longer in the mansion, but outside in Gravity Falls. When she looked down, she realized she was now 100 feet tall, and every step she made was wrecking the town. She knocked over the mudflap factory, polluting the river. She knocked over the orphanage, sending coughing soot-covered children out into the cold.</p>
<p>She kept apologizing, but she was too big, too public, every step hurting more and more people. Everyone could see that the townâs problems were her fault. She was a monster. She always had been. <em>She always would be.</em></p>
<p>Pacifica started sobbing and suddenly, she was a little girl again, hiding behind the vine-covered tombstones in the graveyard behind the Manor after another one of her parents fights. The graves of her ancestors loomed above her like gargoyles, great Northwests in history. What would they say if they could see her like this?</p>
<p>One of the statues slowly turned to face Pacifica. It was Nathaniel Northwest.</p>
<p style="color: #FFC000">âGet a hold of yourself. Youâre a Northwest, people canât know you leak shame-water.â</p>
<p><span style="color: #E035F4">âYouâre right,â</span> Pacifica apologized, and hastily took out her compact to clean her smeared makeup. She cursed as she saw how dishevelled she was.</p>
<p>The statue watched her like a cat hungrily watching a mouse.</p>
<p style="color: #FFC000">âYou have a lot of anger, donât you.â</p>
<p style="color: #E035F4">âAnyone whose not angry is an idiot. Thereâs so much to be mad about.â</p>
<p style="color: #FFC000">âYes. Anger is good. Anger is useful. Who are you angry at, Pacifica?â</p>
<p style="color: #E035F4">âEverything was better before the <em>PINES</em> came to town...â</p>
<p style="color: #FFC000">âYou know, I might be able to help with that... thereâs something I want. The Mystery Shack is going to be getting some new merchandise very soon. A small snow globe, nothing anyone would miss. If you could shoplift it for me, I could guarantee things would change. Youâd never deal with the Pines again...â</p>
<p>Pacifica closed her compact. Would that fix everything?</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="color: #FFC000; font-size: 32px">âIt would be so easy... all you have to do to get your old life back is shake...my...handâ</p>
<p>The statue extended its stony hand. Thunder rumbled in the distance.</p>
<img src="image_3.png"/>
<p style="margin-top: -2rem">Slowly she reached out to shake- then abruptly stopped. Something was off.</p>
<p style="color: #AC27BD">âMy old life... wasnât really mine, was it? All I ever did was follow my mom and dad. Maybe... it would be better to...make a new one.â</p>
<p>The STATUE BELLOWED with RAGE.</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="color: #FFC000; font-size: 32px"><strong style="font-size: 40px">âMAKE?</strong> HA! YOU <strong style="font-size: 40px">INHERIT</strong>. YOUR FAMILY LEGACY IS ALL YOUâRE WORTH. YOU MAKE NOTHING.<br/>YOU CANâT EVEN MAKE FRIENDS.â</p>
<p>This had always been true... in the past.</p>
<p>His hand extended toward her. Looming. Trembling.<br/>She remembered a time when a hand extended toward her, offering a free snack in the back seat of a car.</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="color: #FFC000; font-size: 32px">âMAKE THE DEAL YOU LITTLE FAKE BLONDE IMPENDING PATERNITY TESTâ</p>
<p>Pacificaâs face relaxed.<br/>She knew it was clichÃ©, but she knew she had to do it.<br/>She slowly extended her hand.<br/>Just as the giant lichen-covered hand was about to close around hers like a cage of stone fingers, she swung her arm up and behind her head.</p>
<p style="color: #AC27BD">âSike.â</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="color: #FFC000; font-size: 32px">âWHAT?!â</p>
<p style="color: #AC27BD">âToo slow!â</p>
<p class="font-kidwriting" style="color: #FFC000; font-size: 32px">âYOU WORM!!!! YOU WORTHLESS WASTE OF STOLEN INCOME!!!! YOUâLL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. I SEE A FUTURE WHERE YOUâRE PENNILESS, WORKING AT THE DINER, YOUâLL HAVE NOTHING, YOU-â</p>
<p>The statue shook with rage, sending cracks from its hand all the way up to its shrieking head.<br/>It crumbled apart in front of her, screaming in pain.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1rem"><em>GONG!</em></p>
<p>Pacifica awoke with a start, panting.  The clock in the hallway had struck 3 AM. She was covered in sweat. What had she been dreaming about? She couldnât remember.<br/>She didnât want to remember.</p>
<p>She wasnât quite sure why, but she removed a tapestry that sheâd always had on her wall. Something her family had no doubt looted ages ago- of a glowing triangle over the mountains. She rolled it up and put it in the closet and locked the padlock. Maybe she should hold onto Dipperâs number just in case. She entered it into her phone and felt an odd sense of calm suddenly wash over her.<br/>It was quiet once again in Northwest Manor.</p>
<p>Pacifica slept better than she had in years.</p>
